1. *Titanic Data Analysis and Prediction* : This demonstrates a complete data cleaning pipeline for the Titanic dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. A Random Forest Classifier model is trained on the cleaned data to predict passenger survival, and the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated based on accuracy.
