This repository contains a series of data analysis and machine learning notebooks. 

1. *Titanic Data Analysis and Prediction* : This demonstrates a complete data cleaning pipeline for the Titanic dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. A Random Forest Classifier model is trained on the cleaned data to predict passenger survival, and the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated based on accuracy.
2.  *Netflix Title Visualizations* : This notebook explores the Netflix titles dataset from Kaggle, providing insightful visualizations on various aspects of the content, such as genre distribution, ratings, release trends, and more.
3.  *A B Testing* : Synthetic data is generated to simulate an A/B test with two groups, where conversion rates are assigned based on a 15% baseline probability. The average conversion rate for each group is calculated, a two-sample t-test is performed to determine if the difference between the groups is statistically significant (rejecting the null hypothesis if p-value < 0.05). Finally, a bar plot is used to visually compare the conversion rates of the two groups.
