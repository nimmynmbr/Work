This repository contains a series of data analysis and machine learning notebooks. 

1. *Titanic Data Analysis and Prediction* : This demonstrates a complete data cleaning pipeline for the Titanic dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. A Random Forest Classifier model is trained on the cleaned data to predict passenger survival, and the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated based on accuracy.
2.  *Netflix Title Visualizations* : This notebook explores the Netflix titles dataset from Kaggle, providing insightful visualizations on various aspects of the content, such as genre distribution, ratings, release trends, and more.
